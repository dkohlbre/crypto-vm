# Welcome to Crypto vm!
========

This is a collection of previously
used [ctf](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) problems focused on
cryptography, math, and related topics.


## How to use?
===========

Choose a category, then a problem, and work on it!  Each problem comes
with a set of hints (with suggested readings) and either a full
solution or a link to one.

## What am I supposed to do with a problem?
==========

"Find the flag!"
What that means depends on the problem.

With crypography related problems you will usually get it in one of two ways:

* Find a plaintext(flag) from some encrypted data
* Submit a message/solution that matches some criteria to a server that will return you a flag.

A "flag" is a string that is the 'end goal' of any CTF
problem. Generally it will look like one of the following:

* "Leet Speak", ex: "gr34T\_J0b\_haxx1n9"
* Hash sum, ex: "065e9bcf04a1b33d926214ac235056c7e4572726"
* Anything that says "Flag", ex: "flag{065e9bcf04a1b33d926214ac235056c7e4572726}"

Generally "you will know it when you find it" is good advice.
