Type: Hash Length Extension


Original text:
A simple betting game.

User connects and the server and a "session" starts. The server generates a
nonce for the session, and asks the user to input their own nonce. The server
requests the odds the user wants and then the user's guess. If
sha1(server_nonce+user_nonce)%odds == user_guess, they win.

To verify the server isn't cheating, the user can request for the server_nonce
to be displayed, which will also reset the server_nonce to something else.
