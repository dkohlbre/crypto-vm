By studying the given code we learn that we have to enter the correct number 10 times, after which the program will give us the flag. The most important part is the following:


	def encrypt(bits, m):
	    p = random_prime(bits)
	    q = random_prime(bits)
	    n = p * q
	    assert m < n
	    print n
	    print m ** 3 % n
	    print (m + 1) ** 3 % n


The program gives us `n`, `m ** 3 % n` and `(m + 1) ** 3 % n` and asks us `m` in return. After some research on RSA encryption we notice that this encryption can be broken because we are given two encrypted messages. We know those messages are encrypted using the same key and related to each other. This is also known as a [Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%27s_Attack#Franklin-Reiter_Related_Message_Attack). This leads us to the next formula:

	((m + 1) ** 3 +  2 * m ** 3 - 1) / ((m + 1) ** 3 - m ** 3 + 2) = m mod n

We can use the [extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) to calculate `m` from this formula. Here is a snippet of the Python code I wrote:

	# Return a triple `(g, x, y)` such that `ax + by = g = gcd(a, b)`.
	def egcd(a, b):
	  if a == 0:
	    return (b, 0, 1)
	  else:
	    g, y, x = egcd(b % a, a)
	    return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)

	m_n1 = m_31 + 2*m_3 - 1
	m_n2 = m_31 - m_3 + 2
	f = m_n1%n
	g = m_n2%n
	sol1 = egcd(f,n)
	sol2 = egcd((1-n*sol1[2])*g/f,n)
	m = sol2[1]
	m2 = -m
	if m < 0:
	  m += n
	# If it’s not really `m`, it’s the mod inv of `m`.
	if (m ** 3 % n) != m_3:
	  m = m2
	if m < 0:
	  m += n

This decrypts our given strings into the message we need to return.

Finally the program gave us a final message holding the key. Of course we had to decrypt that one too.

The flag is `HITCON{RSA is a really secure algorithm, right?}`.
