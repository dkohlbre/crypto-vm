\section{Future Work} Due to the limited time of the project, there are still a
number of improvements that we plan on implementing in the future. For this
initial version, we focused on getting the basic functionality well working,
allowing for easy addition of problems.

Most importantly, we plan on adding significantly more problems from previous
CTF competitions and other available sources like \cite{ctf:github} to the VM.
Additionally, we are going to publish \cvm{} and promote it in the CTF
community to get people to contribute their problems.

To avoid overwhelming new users, we intend to create other configuration
options that will only select a subset of the available problems at random. This
will include an option for a competition mode, which will only include 5
problems from different categories and not display any hints or solutions before
the flag is solved. This mode is supposed to be used after getting familiar with
the typical problem types and structures of cryptography CTF problems to prepare
for an actual CTF competition.

Another useful feature we intend to add is a difficulty rating for each problem
to help beginners find adequate problems. We already allow for such a setting
in the configuration file, but we are currently not using it when generating
the pages.

And last, we plan on further improving the site layout and design to make it
more appealing and intuitive to use.
