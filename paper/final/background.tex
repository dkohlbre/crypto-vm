\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
CTF competitions have been including cryptography related challenges
for well over a decade. As with other challenges, the complexity of
crypto challenges has grown over time; from mostly classical ciphers
and basic operations to requiring competitors to implement cutting
edge cryptanalysis and attacks.

Most modern competitions post some version of the challenges they
developed after the competition is over. However, these challenges are
generally just raw development files with little to no explanation of
how to operate them. Many competition teams use these previous
challenges as practice, but getting them working without discovering
the solution can be impossible.
