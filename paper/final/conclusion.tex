\section{Conclusion}
\cvm{} is a simple to use, simple to contribute to, hosting platform
for cryptographic puzzles. These puzzles are taken from previous CTF
challenges to both archive them and to make them available for
practice.

We hope that future problem authors will add their challenges to
\cvm{} and that \cvm{} will become a standard practice tool used by
CTF teams worldwide. If it is picked up by the community, we will
continue to maintain it and add features as they become needed.
